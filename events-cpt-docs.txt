/**
 * ConBook Events Plugin Overview
 *
 * This plugin provides a basic MVP events management system in WordPress.
 * It allows you to manage Events (Custom Post Type), Tickets, Registrations, and Payments.
 *
 * Key Features and Additions:
 *
 * 1. Event Custom Post Type (CPT)
 *    - Registers an "Event" post type for creating and managing events.
 *    - Supports title, editor, thumbnail, and excerpt.
 *
 * 1a. Event Meta Boxes
 *    - Adds extra fields to the Event CPT in the admin:
 *        • Start Date
 *        • End Date
 *        • Start Time
 *        • End Time
 *        • Location
 *    - Saves these fields securely using WordPress post meta.
 *
 * 2. Custom Database Tables on Activation
 *    - Creates 5 custom tables for advanced event management:
 *        • event_attendees     → Stores attendee info
 *        • event_tickets       → Stores tickets linked to events
 *        • event_payments      → Stores payments and uploaded proof-of-payment files
 *        • event_registrations → Links attendees, tickets, and events with statuses
 *        • event_payment_options → Stores payment options for each event
 *
 * 3. Admin Menu + Subpages
 *    - Adds a main menu "ConBook Events" and submenus for:
 *        • Registrations
 *        • Tickets
 *        • Payments
 *
 * 4. Admin Page Placeholders
 *    - Simple placeholder pages for the above admin menus for future implementation.
 *
 * 5. Safe Deletion of Related Event Data
 *    - Hooks into 'before_delete_post' to remove all data linked to an Event when it's deleted:
 *        • Deletes all post meta for the event
 *        • Deletes registrations and associated payments, including uploaded files safely
 *        • Deletes tickets linked to the event
 *        • Deletes payment options linked to the event
 *    - Ensures no orphaned database records or leftover files remain.
 *
 * 6. Bulk Clean Test Events Admin Page
 *    - Adds an admin submenu "Bulk Clean" to quickly delete all test events.
 *    - Example uses search term 'test' in event titles.
 *    - Deletes all related data for matching events (tickets, registrations, payments, files, post meta).
 *
 * Notes:
 *    - The deletion logic is safe and smart: it will not throw errors if files are missing.
 *    - You can safely test events, delete them, and know the database remains clean.
 *    - Future improvements could include frontend forms for creating events and handling registrations.
